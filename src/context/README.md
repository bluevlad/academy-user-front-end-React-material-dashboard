# Context Directory

This directory contains React Context files used for global state management across the application.

## Files

- **index.js**: The main UI Controller Context (likely `MaterialUIControllerProvider`) which manages the visual state of the application, such as theme settings, sidenav state, and layout configurations.

## Usage

Wrap your application or part of the component tree with the provider components to grant access to the global state. Use the corresponding hooks to consume the context values.
